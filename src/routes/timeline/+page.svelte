          Over the past few decades, while homeownership rates for both the general population and white residents in Middlesex County have steadily risen‚Äîfrom 37% to 62% overall, and from 47% to 67% for white residents‚Äîthe Black homeownership rate has remained stagnant at around 30%. Despite increased access to mortgage loans for minority groups, the disparity in homeownership rates between minority groups, particularly Black people, and white residents persists, underscoring the enduring legacy of historical injustices. This trend is also linked to the historically small Black population in Middlesex County, which totaled 84,670 residents in 2020. Our project aims to highlight the intergenerational impacts of restrictive covenants, which systematically excluded people of color from the wealth-building opportunities that white homeowners were able to benefit from through home equity.
