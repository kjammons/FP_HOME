    This project is inspired by and developed in accordance with the long-term goals of the 
    <a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/projects/massachusetts-covenants-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      Massachusetts Covenants Project
    </a>. 
    With this visualization, we present disaggregated American Community Survey (ACS) data to give users agency to understand the landscapes of homeownership and race across the county, informed by the current extent of archival study for the Massachusetts Covenants Project. 
    The framing of white and non-white is situated within an investigation of the social construction of whiteness, which restrictive covenants expose as malleable and weaponized according to changing biases. 
    As researchers, we believe this presentation of present dynamics cannot be separated from the discriminatory practices that brought it into being by design.
