      This project was produced with data from the <strong>Massachusetts Covenants Project</strong>, a partner of MassHousing. These learning modules were authored and implemented by Kristen Ammons, Shreya Bansal, Emilia Charno, and Marine Gapihan, for MIT’s Interactive Data Visualization & Society Course (11.C85/6.C85). All data visualizations and insights expressed are those of the individual authors. This project was also developed with guidance and feedback from the <a href="https://www.mapc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metropolitan Area Planning Commission (MAPC)</a>.

    <h2>Introduction: The Social Construction of Whiteness</h2>

    <p>
      Housing discrimination remains one of the most powerful tools for creating and maintaining racial inequality in the United States by design. Through mechanisms like restrictive covenants, redlining, and exclusionary zoning, access to land and wealth has been systematically reserved for those deemed “white.” Beneath these policies lies a deeper story: “whiteness” itself — far from being a natural or biological category — is a socially constructed tool meant to consolidate power, privilege, and belonging.

    <p>
      Whiteness as a tool of possession and dispossession is both socially constructed and dynamic. It is a definition that demonstrably evolved to confer privilege, restrict opportunity, and preserve social hierarchies. This process has been enforced and maintained through the full apparatus of American life: law, housing, education, labor, and cultural practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Massachusetts, new insights from public property deeds, scanned and examined in the aggregate to identify trends, ground a social construction of whiteness in local form. Middlesex County, with proliferating white suburban developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, offers a case study in how racialized landscapes were deliberately manufactured through property law and decentralized neighborhood action. This project, and its three educational modules, tell the story of one understudied tool in constructing regimes of white supremacy in housing: restrictive covenants.

    <p>
      Restrictive covenants are clauses that were inserted into property deeds to prevent people who were not white from buying or occupying land (<em>Mapping Prejudice, University of Minnesota</em>). Restrictive covenants proliferated separately from government-sponsored means of discrimination like redlining or exclusionary zoning, embodying a populist, insidious desire of neighbors to exclude fellow neighbors. Private actors — such as developers, homeowners' associations, real estate boards, and individual property owners — wielded covenants to the ends of racial and ethnic segregation. These covenants still “run with the land,” alive in property deeds although now ruled unenforceable and illegal following a series of Supreme Court cases and national legislation: <em>Hansberry v. Lee</em> (1940), <em>Shelley v. Kraemer</em> (1948), and the <em>Fair Housing Act</em> (1968).
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal in highlighting these covenants is to reveal their role in racialized exclusion. Additionally, we confront the historical processes by which socially constructed whiteness was continually reasserted and maintained: through neighborhood control, economic gatekeeping, and the manipulation of law.
